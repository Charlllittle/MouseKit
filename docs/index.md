**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026

## Introduction

Welcome to MouseKit. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.

> **TL;DR:** MouseKit does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data. All data stays on your device and your local network.

## Information We Don't Collect

MouseKit is designed with privacy in mind. We do not:

- Collect any personal information
- Track your usage or behavior

- Send any data to external servers
- Share information with third parties
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies

## How MouseKit Works

MouseKit is a local network remote control application that allows you to control your computer from your iPhone or iPad. Here's how your data is handled:

### Local Storage

The only data stored by MouseKit is saved device configurations (name and IP address) stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults. This information:

- Never leaves your device
- Is only used to remember your saved computers
- Can be deleted at any time by removing the app
- Is never synced to iCloud or other services

### Network Communication

MouseKit communicates directly with your computer over your local WiFi network:

- All communication happens on your local network only
- No data is sent over the internet
- The app requires WiFi connectivity and will not use cellular data
- Communication is limited to mouse, keyboard, and control inputs

## Device Permissions

MouseKit requires the following permissions:

- **Local Network Access:** Required to discover and connect to computers on your local network

These permissions are only used for their stated purpose and no data is collected or transmitted beyond your local network.

## Children's Privacy

MouseKit does not collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app can be safely used by users of all ages.
